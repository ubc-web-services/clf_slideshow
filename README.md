CLF SLIDESHOW
=============

A Slideshow Feature with default CLF Styling

This feature will create a new content type called 'Article with Slideshow.' Adding new articles with the 'Feature on the Homepage Carousel' option selected and images / image captions will populate a slideshow block. You can then enable this feature and place where you like (I guess it doesn't have to go on the homepage, really).
